# Cleaning Services Website  

This repository hosts the website for our cleaning services project. The **level-one branch** contains the latest UX updates and is the branch to use for running the website during development or review. The **main branch** is reserved for stable, production-ready versions of the site.  

## Requirements  
To run the website locally, you will need:  
- A live server (e.g., Live Server extension for VS Code or any local development server).  
- Git installed on your system.  

## How to Run the Website  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   -  Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IbrahimOraby/cleaning-services-project.git
   cd cleaning-services

2. **Checkout the level-one Branch**  
   -  Fetch the latest changes:
   
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```
   -  Switch to the level-one branch:
       
   ```bash
   git checkout level-one
   ```
   -  Pull the latest updates from the levelone branch:
     
   ```bash
   git pull origin level-one
   ```
   
3. **To view the website, use a live server**
   1. If you're using Visual Studio Code:
      - Open the project folder in VS Code.
      - Right-click on `index.html` in the Explorer.
      - Select **Open with Live Server**.

   2. **Alternatively**, you can use any other live server to host the files locally.
